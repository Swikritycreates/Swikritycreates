## About me

Hi, I'm Swikriti 👋  

I'm a Computer Science student at Smith College (class of 2028) who likes building backend systems, data integrations, and tools that automate boring work.  

Recently I've been:
- 🔁 Building Salesforce automations and workflows that support 10+ departments at Smith
- 🔗 Creating integration pipelines that sync event and ticket data between campus systems and remove hours of manual work every month
- 🧠 Working on AI powered text digitization for low resource scripts using OpenCV and PyTorch

---

### What I work with

- 💻 Languages: Python, Java, C++, C, SQL, JavaScript  
- 🌐 Web and data: REST APIs, JSON, XML, HTML, CSS, TypeScript  
- ☁ Cloud and DevOps: Azure, GitHub Actions, Docker, PowerShell, Bash  
- 🧰 Tools and frameworks: Git, SnapLogic, Salesforce, OpenCV, PyTorch, MATLAB  

---

### Projects I enjoyed

- **PESCAPE**  
  Text based escape room game in Java using object oriented design and modular command handling.

- **WAFFLE**  
  Autonomous mobile robot that detects and responds to simulated fires using sensor input and basic navigation logic.

---

### Right now

- 📚 Studying algorithms, theory, microprocessors, and statistics  
- 🤖 Exploring machine learning and computer vision through side projects  
- 🤝 Open to collaborating on backend, data, or ML focused projects
